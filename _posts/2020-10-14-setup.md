I have recently switched from Ubuntu to Manjaro, and here is how I set everything up for this new environment. I tried setting up Arch Linux for this laptop, but I thought I don't need that much of a bleeding edge distro and stability is a concern for me, so I settled for Manjaro.

## Code and Git

### Visual studio code

VScode is arguably the most versatile development environment I have used. 

set up

plug ins

remote

### R on server

set up launcher

sync with external drive (MEGA)

### Latex, Better Bibtex latex workshop

## Texlive on Arch linux
Following the [Arch linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live)

Install texlive-core, -bin, biber

Install tllocalmgr

## VScode as Tex editor

Plugins

## Zotero integration with Bibtex

Download better bibtex plug-in, install within Zotero
Set cite key
Generate collection automatic update .bib file

### Mathcha

### Git journal (Android)
It's super handy to have a raw 'idea' notebook where you can immediately dot down interesting ideas worth exploring later. Paper based systems are fine, but I often get random ideas in the middle of nowhere with no access to pen and paper.

## Project and time management

Even though a clean directory and codes are essential

### Zenkit
