## Issues out of the box
1. Secondary battery not charging (https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T-series-Laptops/T480-Does-not-switch-to-secondary-battery-turns-off-unexpectedly-Win10/m-p/4398417)
2. Windows update issue, hardware https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht071034-windows-setup-could-not-configure-windows-on-this-computers-hardware-installation-error-on-a-windows-7-based-or-a-windows-server-2008-r2-based-computer

## Hardware upgrades

### RAM
i7-8550U 1.8 GHz 4.0 GHz 8MB DDR4-2400
This is easy, I just need a DDR4-2400 RAM, but since it came with Ra

### M.2 NVME SSD
From [platform specification file](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_T580/ThinkPad_T580_Spec.PDF)

    Storage
    System has one HDD slot or one M.2 2280 slot exclusively for storage
    **Some:HDD / SATA 6.0Gb/s, 2.5" wide, 7mm high,Active Protection System**üëà mine
    Some:SSD / SATA 6.0Gb/s, 2.5" wide, 7mm high (e.g. xxxGB SSD)
    Some:M.2 SSD / PCIe NVMe, PCIe 3.0 x 2, 16Gb/s
    Some:128GB M.2 SSD / PCIe NVMe, PCIe 3.0 x 2, 16Gb/s, in WWAN slot as 2nd Storage, mutually exclusive with WWAN

    Optane memory Optical
    Optional: Intel Optane memory, PCIe NVMe, PCIe 3.0 x 2None

Supported up to PCIe 3.0 x2, so even though it's backwards compatible, it would be a waste of money.

#### Form factor
Card nomenclature is as follow
    E.G.:  ‚ÄúTYPE 2242-D2-B-M‚ÄùThis indicates a 22x42mm card, double-sided, with keys in the B and M positions (can fit B or M connector!)

See this [WD full specs sheet](https://www.sandisk.com/content/dam/sandisk-main/en_us/assets/resources/data-sheets/Western-Digital-PC-SN520-Commercial-Datasheet.pdf) for more examples.

Different types of keys are reserved for different functions (see slide 17 of the SINA webcast). If the card is a B key, then it will have a notch at the 12-19th pin out of 75.

Peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) 3.0 x2 means the third generation of PCIe with 2 lanes. What are the other lanes used for? (I will add this when I find that post again...)

### Git authentication

VScode versions for Arch based systems
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Visual_Studio_Code


personal access token https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

VScodium login, you need to manually change the link https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/issues/401#issuecomment-631502370 for github logging in

https://vscode-auth.github.com/authorize/?callbackUri=**vscodium**://vscode.github-authentication/...
https://vscode-auth.github.com/authorize/?callbackUri=**vscode**://vscode.github-authentication/...


You will get this error for Manjaro

If you get an error that says they can't find a file for your credential, 

> Writing login information to the keychain failed with error 'No such interface ‚Äúorg.freedesktop.Secret.Collection‚Äù on object at path /org/freedesktop/secrets/collection/login'.

install gnome-keyring
add to automatically starting https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63107939/visual-studio-code-asking-to-authenticate-default-keyring-everytime-i-start

Restart VScode, do a pull, and it'll ask for a new password for gnome-keyring if it's your first time pulling.

Then this should be all set up.

And run 
    https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git

    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=2629743'

so that it would remember your password and doesn't 

Before you make your first commit, save your user.name and user.email
git config --global user.name "itsme"
[alex@t580 obsidians]$ git config --global user.email hello@world.org

it turns out that remote SSH extension refuses to work with any OSS version, and would only work with the branded version of VScode...

remember to disable telementary in your new MS built VS code https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting


## Using R on VScode
adding snippets to your VScode

bring up the keyboard shortcut JSON, insert this

   // Rstudio like shortcuts
    {
        "key": "ctrl+,",
        "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'r'",
        "args": {
          "snippet": " <- "
        }
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+m",
        "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'r'",
        "args": {
          "snippet": " %>% "
        }
    },
    {
        "key": "ctrl+i",
        "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'r'",
        "args": {
          "snippet": " %in% "
        }
    },


## Zotero

Zotero https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zotero/
(flatpak version will make your Zotero blind to your MEGA folder)

### Megasync
In order to get the files to sync automatically the moment you save a 
pacman install: megasync (do not use the flatpak version!), dolphin-megasync-git
https://mega.io/sync download directly from the MEGA website

### Zotfile
https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/set-up-best-reference-manager/

- set Zotfile source folder, location of files
- general setting custom data directory

### OBS studio
The main program is OBS studio https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/obs-studio/
however you will need the v4l2loopback to enable sort of a 'virtual camera', which essentially is feeding the screen capture + webcam together as a webcam, since Discord does not support direct OBS streaming https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/v4l2loopback-dkms-git/?comments=all
It didn't work for me at first because I forgot to get headers, sudo pacman -S linux-headers
