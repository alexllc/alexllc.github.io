## Hardware upgrades

### RAM
i7-8550U 1.8 GHz 4.0 GHz 8MB DDR4-2400
This is easy, I just need a DDR4-2400 RAM, but since it came with Ra

### M.2 NVME SSD
From [platform specification file](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_T580/ThinkPad_T580_Spec.PDF)

    Storage
    System has one HDD slot or one M.2 2280 slot exclusively for storage
    **Some:HDD / SATA 6.0Gb/s, 2.5" wide, 7mm high,Active Protection System**üëà mine
    Some:SSD / SATA 6.0Gb/s, 2.5" wide, 7mm high (e.g. xxxGB SSD)
    Some:M.2 SSD / PCIe NVMe, PCIe 3.0 x 2, 16Gb/s
    Some:128GB M.2 SSD / PCIe NVMe, PCIe 3.0 x 2, 16Gb/s, in WWAN slot as 2nd Storage, mutually exclusive with WWAN

    Optane memory Optical
    Optional: Intel Optane memory, PCIe NVMe, PCIe 3.0 x 2None

Supported up to PCIe 3.0 x2, so even though it's backwards compatible, it would be a waste of money.

#### Form factor
Card nomenclature is as follow
    E.G.:  ‚ÄúTYPE 2242-D2-B-M‚ÄùThis indicates a 22x42mm card, double-sided, with keys in the B and M positions (can fit B or M connector!)

See this [WD full specs sheet](https://www.sandisk.com/content/dam/sandisk-main/en_us/assets/resources/data-sheets/Western-Digital-PC-SN520-Commercial-Datasheet.pdf) for more examples.

Different types of keys are reserved for different functions (see slide 17 of the SINA webcast). If the card is a B key, then it will have a notch at the 12-19th pin out of 75.

Peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) 3.0 x2 means the third generation of PCIe with 2 lanes. What are the other lanes used for? (I will add this when I find that post again...)
